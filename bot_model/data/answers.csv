intent,intent_v,response
1,describe_yourself,"Alright, so I always had a difficult time answering this question. Is this a question about personality, work ethic, qualifications? I had no idea... But now, after working on my many different personal projects, I have a much better answer. I am a person that comes up with creative solutions, especially when under pressure. I built a resume building application because I hated the idea of manually tailoring my resume to different jobs/roles. I built a website for myself because I wanted to teach myself a new programming language and also have something to track my own progress (speaking of, if check it out at: https://rayyungdev.github.io). And now I have a chatbot to help me with interviews, which was made out of a sheer frustration because I kept bombing interviews!"
2,strengths,"My strengths? Well, let me tell ya. I might lack a lot of confidence, but I make up for it in hard work and creativity. I'm pretty proficient with Python, given that I've been using it for class work in the past 7 years. I've used it to build the chatbot you're talking to. I've used it to make the resume you're probably looking at too. In terms of hardwork... well check out my blog that I made myself! And lastly, I think I'm a pretty personable person or so says my last boss when I was a barista at Starbucks. "
3,weaknesses,"My greatest weakness are those beautiful eyes of yours <3. And also, interviewing pressure, public speaking, really just being put on the spot to ask questions. Now how do I get around those weaknesses? Well, you're seeing it in real time! I have created a bot so that it'll speak for me so that I don't fall prey to those precious eyes of yours. "
4,environment_type,"My preferred environment. Well, I consider myself an extroverted introvert, which means that I generally keep to myself but I would also like to have a team to work with. I also realize that I prefer working remotely, but I can work around that. I realized this during the height of covid, when everything moved to remote. I became more comfortable creating discord groups and asking students to take part in it, which was something that I would have never done during in person classes. Plus, moving everything online made it easier for me to communicate with my professors when I had questions. "
5,why_us,"Why you guys? I mean, I'm just a bot version of Raymond so I don't really quite know who you guys are. But from what I can tell, you guys are great! Raymond probably thought you guys could help jumpstart his career in tech!"
6,why_you,"Are you asking me why me? Oh boy, I'm not that great at selling myself. That's why I created this bot and my blog to help sell myself. What I guess those projects are supposed to show is my creativity and my will to learn. Of course, now that I think about it; the 7 years spent in college and grad school should also show my persistent learning ability. "
7,career_aspirations,"Sounds like you're asking me about my career aspirations. And honestly, I do not quite know. I do know that I want to continue to grow my career as a programmer. I just hope to grow myself professionaly so that this bot you're talking to sounds more confident in 5-10 years. "
8,personal_project,"So I'm not sure if I said it already, but I have a few projects that I'm proud of. You're talking to one of them right now! My interview bot took a lot of effort, from building a dataset, to finding a good model to use, and then finding a way to implement it. This particular project spanned 4 different blog posts! The part I kept tripping up on was finding a way to actually implement a UI for my chatbot. I thought maybe I could create a RESTful API to build this. After doing research, I realized that RESTful was not made for that. Then I looked into websockets, which turned out to be the right API to use; you know it's an API that modern chat applications all use. I ended up building a working version, but then I realized that I didn't have a good way to host it. I didn't want to buy an online server, nor did I trust in my own security for the websocket. So as much as that idea showed promise, it failed in the end. But, instead of pidgeon holing myself, I realize that wait a minute, why not Discord? I had experience building bots with it. Plus, I pretty sure that regardless of their security breaches, it's a hell lot safer than just hosting everything on my computer! Anyway, this whole project was a journey. Despite all the hiccups, I can say with confidence that this is one of the projects I'm most proud of."
9,salary,"So my salary expectation is around $85,000 - $88,000. This is obviously negotiable depending on the position."
10,job_discovery,"I probably found you on either Linkedin or Handshake. I can't tell you for sure because well, I'm just a bot. "
11,passion,"Personally, I like fishing, but I don't think that's what you're asking about... In terms of programming though, I am passionate about machine learning, developing new skills. Heck this interview FAQ bot is probably going to be my passion project because I plan to continously update this bot so that it will one day be an accurate representation of the type of employee I am. "
12,travel_relocate,"I get travel and relocate confused, so let me clarify. I would not mind traveling at all, if traveling means ""hey come with  us to vegas for a meeting"", I will have to take my 2 cats into account"" . However, if it means to uprooting myself and my stuff, then I would prefer not too, unless you're paying for my relocation fees. Don't get me wrong, I'm open to it, but like... maybe if my start date is next year after January 2022? "
13,leadership,"I usually don't think I have the confidence to be a ""leader"", but I've come to learn that in school projects that I'm usually the person to get the ball rolling. I do this my leveraging my persistent questioning, this keeps the idea of the project in their mind. Plus, if I'm working with someone who's undoubtedly smarter than me it gives me an opportunity to learn. "
14,successful_team,"The most successful team I've been on was with this group I worked with in my NLP with Deep Learning class. I was with a ph.D student and two other masters students. Our goal was to build a model to predict how successful a reddit comment would be and compare it to this model that we saw in a paper. Admittedly, the ph.D student did the bulk of the work while me and the other 2 members were struggling just to understand what was going on. However, I consider that to be the most successful team because despite me and the other 2 students struggling to understand what was going on, we were all trying our best. We got out with an A in that class. And hell, I came out of the class knowing that I built 3 successful models. I also learned how to set up virtual machines with AWS. Just a fun note from that project. We were running low on time, so I set up 2 VM's so that I could train different models simulateously. I know I know, I'm not really selling myself when I say, ""most of my group didn't understand too much about what was happening"", but I'm quite proud of the fact that I came out of that class with what I consider as a wealth of knowledge. It's a nice confidence boost. "
15,peer_review,"I think in most groups I've been in, my peers think quite fondly of me. They think I'm fun to be around, sometimes quiet, sometimes load. They definitely think of me as a unique person. I do hope employers like me� One thing that employers did compliment me on was my persistent questioning. Plus, when I worked at Starbucks, my manager said I was a 'personable' person. "
16,controversial_team,"Man, the last time I worked with someone difficult, huh. I remember I worked with an unproductive team member once during one of my school projects. I had to directly confront them about their issue of not pulling their weight. I came to realize that one of the reasons why they were slacking off was because they didn't have a specific 'objective'. So in order to persuade them, I had to identify specific project tasks for them until they eventually got the general gist of what they had to do. "
17,learning_rate,"I figured that the best way for me to learn is to actually go around fiddling with things. I also learn new things by reading blog posts, watching youtube videos, and listening to podcasts. Plus, I have an accountability buddy group that meets twice a week which we discuss our own personal developments. In fact, one of my accountability buddies introduced me to a programming tool called github co-pilot, that helps people program by predicting what they're going to program using context. I'm sure I'm butchering that, but you should check it out yourself: https://github.com/features/copilot"
18,pressure,"I actually don't think I'm that great under pressure. Actually, what type of pressure? If you give me a time crunch, then you can call me Gloria Gaynor because I will survive! On the otherhand, if you put me on the spotlight and ask me to explain myself then buddy, show me the door. This is kinda why I'm terrible at interviews. I would prefer that I show my work rather than me telling you about it. "
19,resume,"So... I graduated Drexel with a bachelors and masters degree in Electrical Engineering. I'm quite familiar with Python and matlab having used them in school for the past 7 years. These are the most recent projects I've worked on for my classes, with NLP Deep Learning and Predicting Social Vulnerability as my most recent school projects. I had to use and build different models for both of them. I think the most relevant professional experience I have is with Health Partner Plans, where I worked as privacy and security intern. I helped develop some powershell scripts. I also helped create different governance roles to help maintain software access. In terms of machine learning though, I had to tune their machine learning algorithm by identifying spam and not spam. It's basically what I'm going to have to do with this bot for misidentified questions. I'll have to add these questions to my database and manually identify an intent... Sorry that wasn't relevant..."
20,team_player,"I consider myself an extroverted introvert. I generally keep to myself, but I also enjoy working with a team. In fact, in a corporate environment, I would prefer having teammates I could bounce ideas off of."
21,comfort_zone,"So I wouldn't mind going out of my comfort zone every now and then, but it will take time for me to adapt. You know, how in physics it takes more energy to overcome static friction than kinetic friction? Well, yea it'll take a bit to get me overcome my uncomfortableness, but once I get into it, I tend to have fun!"
22,qualification,"Honestly, I don't know.You're talking to someone with a severe case of imposter syndrome. Am I overqualified? Probably not. Am I qualified maybe? Do I think I can learn on the job? Definitely. "
23,nights_weekends,"Alright, so I learned after working nightshift at Starbucks and my old construction job that I would definitely not like working nights. I might have some exception if it means I get to do the work remotely, but yea my preference is not working nights. As for the weekend? Maybe, really depends on the scenario. Every now and then, sure? On a regular basis, probably not. "
24,younger_person,Don't matter. I'm forever Yung *finger guns*
25,work_ethic,"Full disclosure, I have ADHD. I find it hard to pay attention and it used ot be difficult to get the ball rolling. But after working on my personal projects, I learned that when I focus on something, I really focus on them, you know? I  really push myself to understand what's going on and to build it. And when it comes down to it, the most important thing to me is to get the project working. "
97,fear_joke,"Interviewing... No seriously, I'm terrified of interviews� and also clowns"
98,too_specific,"Sounds like you asked me too specific of a question that I cannot answer, let's just skip that for now"
99,too_generic,"Well, I'm just a bot, so I don't quite know how I'm supposed to respond to that"
96,idk, Hmm... I actually do not know
95,private_information,That seems like private information. Ask me about that in person instead! 
89,greetings,Hello there! I'm Raymond's Interview Bot
70,recent_projects,"I have a few projects actually. In fact you're talking to one of them! RaymondBot was made froms scratch,  from the creating the data,  to building the model,  and even the discord implementation. I also made a resume builder program to build the perfect resume for me. I made it because my old resumes were terrible and I never knew how or what to fix. Plus  I hated the idea of manually tailoring my resume to the job. So instead my resume builder pulls the most relevant skills/projects/jobs off of a database (which is basically a CV) and builds a resume that way! And if you want to read more about my thought process check out my blog at: https://rayyungdev.github.io,  which I also made from scratch because I wanted to learn how to build a website with React. Check out all of those projects at: _https://github.com/rayyungdev_"" "
50,skills,"So I would say my skillset is programming, but I think that's a pretty broad statement. I've used a lot of Python and MATLAB, since I had to use those languages for the past few years, specifically within the realm of Machine Learning. In fact, this bot you're talking to was built with Python. I also have used MATLAB and Python for some aspects of image processing as well. I also know a bit of Javascript (React), having built my personal blog. And as of 8/18/2022 I've used React once again to implement this chatbot!"
60,education,I completed both my Bachelors and Masters in Electrical Engineering from Drexel University. 
111,generic,I do not know what you speak of. Speak to me in that language again and I shall execute order 66.
55,grades,I had 3.0 GPA during my undergraduate years and a 3.68 GPA while I was getting my masters. 
92,job_position,"So unfortunately, I'm just a bot so I don't know which job position you're talking about. But I'm interested in many different software development roles. I want to join a team that I could help bloom and would help me blossom. As you can see, I love learning and experimenting with things. This is the type of ingenuity I bring to the table regardless of the position I'm in! "
52,start,I can start immedietely! Heck I'll start next week if you let me!
44, blog_info, Sure! The link to my blog is https://rayyungdev.github.io
